## Another ~side~ main project 

Yeah. I will become a father again in mid 2024. When I started this project, we were in that phase of pregnancy where dads, certainly me as a dad, are useless. The only thing I could do was to be supportive of My sweet half. So, Clo, this is for you. I hope it will cheer you up a little.

And this is also for you little kid. It will be fun in 203X see this page and try to understand what your father had in mind. This will be that kind of weird situations that I hope we will experience often.

Ok. Stop with the daddy late night talking. This is a GitHub readme after all. Let's see the geeky part.

The entire repo is an experiment. I wanted to try Astro, and vanilla JS state of the art today. So state manager is managed via Proxies and component are only... standard web components. Feel free to clone that and make your own. I hope that the internet will be more full of custom, personal and funny website then social profiles :P
